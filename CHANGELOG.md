## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Device farm — interactive multi-device control surface served by `baguette serve`.** A standalone web UI that streams every booted simulator side-by-side, with filtering, sorting, wall / list view modes, and live telemetry per tile. Pieces:
  - **Bezel display mode** with `DeviceFrame` integration; falls back to **9-slice bezel composition** when a device has no packaged frame asset. Chrome buttons can layer above the viewport via `onTop` z-order.
  - **Input round-trips through the existing pipeline** — `SimInputBridge` wires the farm UI's gestures, hardware buttons, and pinch overlay into `GestureDispatcher` → `IndigoHIDInput`, so anything the CLI can drive, the farm UI can drive.
  - **Focused tile mirroring** is a canvas copy — the focus pane re-parents the source canvas directly rather than spinning up a separate `<video>` element.

### Changed
- **Farm grid rendering optimized** — selection updates use delta diffs instead of full re-mounting; element mounting and bezel rendering reworked for fewer DOM writes per frame; wall view layout unified and flexbox-centered.

### Fixed
- **Wrapper sizing now matches bezel image dimensions** so device frames align in the farm grid.
- **Element rendering in raw (no-bezel) mode** correctly handles toggling display modes.
- **`ReconfigParser` number parsing** simplified to handle numeric casting consistently.
